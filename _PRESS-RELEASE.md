There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Game Title: "Okizeme!"

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Learn to read the mind of your opponent!

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Okizeme! is a fun game that will train your mind reading abilities (otherwise known as yomi in Japan)!  Stemming from popular fighting game mechanics, Okizeme! strips away all the complexity of learning difficult combos and advanced techniques.  Okizeme! allows you to focus on what actually makes fighting games fun:  reading the mind of your opponent.  You will start out determining who gets the initiative by a simple game of rock paper scissors,
  from there you will be launched into the Okizeme! guessing game where each correct guess leads to a lowering of your opponents' life bar and 
  further initiative (also known as momentum).  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  This product exposes the heart of fighting games while reducing the amount of time required to become "good".  A lot of the fun involved in
  fighting games revolves around guessing your opponent's next attacks and responding appropriately.  Unfortunately most of your time is lost
  in practice, mastering the physical (and not the mental) aspects.  

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
	
This game will allow players to play this "fun" component on the fly, with a relatively minimal learning curve.  At its core, however, this game will be highly competitive, the more skilled player should always win. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "This game is awesome.  You absolutely have to play it.  Highly addictive, takes only minutes to learn, challenge your friends!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  To get started just find an opponent and play.  You will each be given limited time to make your guess (default mode is 3 seconds).  

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "This game is addicting and fun!  I've always wanted to play more competitive games, but have been intimidated by the steep learning curve involved.
  This game lets me jump right in and play a competitive game, without intimidating me with game mechanics."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
